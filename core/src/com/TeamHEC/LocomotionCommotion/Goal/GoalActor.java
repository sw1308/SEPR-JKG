 * The Goal Actor is used in the goal menu and in playergoal's meaning it needs to keep track of which one it is. It can also be empty which mean it 
 * shows a blank texture and does nothing. 
 * 
 * This is an Actor- meaning it's given texture is displayed on the stage and actions (acts) can be performed.
 * @param texture	The image used for the Actor pulled in from SM_TextureManager (see documentation)
 * @param actorX	The x coordinate of the bottom left corner of the image
 * @param actorY	The y coordinate of the bottom left corner of the image
 * @param started	Boolean used to show if an Actor has been moused over. Used to stop and start interactions.
 * @param touchDown	Boolean used to show if an Actor has been clicked. Used to stop and start interactions.
 * @param empty		Boolean for if the goal is empty (blank- without goal)
 * @param addGoalButtonVisible Boolean for if the addGoalButton is visible 
 * @param planRouteButtonVisible Boolean for if the planRouteButton is visible 
 * @param goal		Goal is the goal object that the ticket represents.
 * @param index		index is a marker for which ticket it is in the grid.
 * @param ownedGoal the boolean for whether the goal is a player goal or one from the goal menu.
 * 
 * setBounds	This is the bounds for the interaction, we make it the whole image.
 * addListener	This adds a listener for a particular interaction in this case touchDown (click)
 * draw			Actor is drawn
 * act			The action taken if the listener detects interaction
 * 				Action- None
